Title: Geog 254, Seeing Geographically: Reimagining Mapping
Date: 05/04/16

## Overview
Maps have become omnipresent in contemporary media as the means for producing them, particularly on the web, have become more widely distributed and easier to use. The ubiquity of maps naturalizes a conservative cartographic visual imaginary, that understands 'space' only via Cartesian absolute coordinates. The contrast with contemporary geography's rich ontologies of scale, place, spatiality, relationality, and process could hardly be more stark.

This class will pose the question of how contemporary graphic and computational methods might be used to reinvent mapping, to make it more fully geographic. We will begin by exploring the conundrum of how more experimental approaches to space and place emerging out of geography's 'quantitative revolution' in the 1960s into the 1980s became submerged by geographical information systems' (GIS) mundane, narrow, Cartesian mapping. In doing so, we will consider whether (and which) ideas from that time might be reinvented in the present to yield a variety of more imaginative geographic representations. Examples might include (among many others) network representations, attempts to capture time-space compression, and interactive visualizations.

The class will emphasize a practical assignment in which students (alone or in groups) create new visual representations of topics of interest. Through the semester we will transition from more reading intensive sessions at the outset to a more collaborative 'studio' style of working as students develop their ideas. No prior experience with GIS, programming, or design is required or expected.


# Sample Readings
A detailed week by week reading plan is still in preparation, but there is lots of material in this broadly defined area, ranging from critical GIS and cartography, counter-mapping and neogeography, to the digital humanities, visualization, and much earlier work in theoretical quantitative geography.  I will be working through much of this material in the summer to put shape it into a sequence that stands a chance of making sense, but this class will also be an opportunity for me to grapple with some of this material in depth for the first time, so I can't provide a week by week reading plan at this stage.

## Learning objectives
This class aims to introduce graduate students in geography (and related fields) to approaches to representing and visualizing geographical ideas and understandings of the world.  The approach is both theoretical and practical.  

The class will ground thinking by drawing on readings in geography, the digital humanities, cartography, and visualization design.  Students will work to develop visual representations (maps, charts, diagrams, etc.) of a topic area of interest to them, drawing on theory for inspiration, but also working through the semester on developing their ideas in conversation with the readings, and with one another.  As semester unfolds it is intended that the class will transition from being theory-led to a more practical 'studio' style, where students alone or in groups work on their projects.  Rather than produce a succession of items, students will work and re-work their ideas visually to arrive at their final submission.


# Requirements
Students will work throughout the semester on a project to create a visual representation (or representations) of some agreed topic of interest.  Assessment will be based on the final submitted project (50%), work through the semester on developing and reworking the project piece (20%), leading class discussion in one week of semester (20%), and overall class participation (10%).


# Tools
It is expected that different projects will call on different datasets, and different methods and tools.  No systematic coverage of available tools will be attempted; instead focused advice for individuals and individual groups will be tailored to the needs of their projects.  Where possible the class will draw on knowledge of students enrolled in the class in the selection and learning of new tools.
