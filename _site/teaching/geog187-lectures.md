# Geog 187 Geographic Information Analysis
This is the timetable and lectures from the last iteration of this class, which I taught at Berkeley, from 2014-18. I have taught this material over many years, in various forms, and at various levels. It draws heavily on content from my book with Dave Unwin *Geographic Information Analysis*. You can access the slides in their web format [here](https://southosullivan.com/geog187/lectures) but there's a high probability of broken links and broken libraries.
