# An *R*-spatial junkyard
I started making these pages when I realised I regularly 'solve' problems in *R* spatial and then promptly forget what I did and have to remember all over again.

In no particular order:

## [Doing kernel density estimation](r-junkyard/kde.html)
Works fine, but is surprisingly tricky, because you have to use more than one package.

## [Evenly distributed random points on the globe](random-even-points-on-the-globe.html)
I have to look this up on stackoverflow every time, so might as well have it on my own website
