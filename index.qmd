This is **Geospatial Stuff** where I offer expertise in data analytics and visualisation, simulation modelling, and [training](training.qmd), on all things geospatial. For more information [get in touch](mailto:osullivan512@gmail.com).

### Research
I am an accomplished geospatial researcher with over 25 years experience. I am an [Honorary Professor](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/david-osullivan) at the University of Auckland and [Research Affiliate at Motu](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/people/david-osullivan/). You can find out more about my academic exploits from the drop-down above, or at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6guUlvgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). There are examples of current work in my [portfolio](portfolio.qmd) and [blog posts](blog.qmd). To summarise:

### Commmunicating ideas
I have written [3 books](books.html) and [numerous research articles](publications.html). I have taught for over 20 years and can put together a mean slide show. For examples, see my [presentations](presentations.html), or [these slides](https://dosull.github.io/Spatial-Data-Science/site/docs/). Years of teaching experience are the basis of [the training I offer](training.qmd).

### Communicating data
I work in **R** and **Python** developing workflows to organise, analyse, and visualize data, especially spatial data. I am a trained cartographer, and have published visual analytics or maps of complex data in research projects and publications. There are many examples among the [blog posts](blog.qmd).

### Wrangling data
While my everyday languages are **Python** and **R**, I have experience in others (notably Java and JavaScript). I write [well organised and documented code](https://dosull.github.io/weaving-space/doc/weavingspace/). I am not a web developer, but will [figure stuff out](posts/2020-07-22-nz-commute-viewer/nz-commute-viewer.qmd) as needed. Most of my web work is linked from these pages, just look around.

### Simulating stuff
I love [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), but admit that it is _niche_, albeit powerful (see [this geographical COVID model I built in lockdown](posts/2020-05-26-covid-model/). I've also written [a book about this](books.html#spatial-simulation-exploring-pattern-and-process).

### Project management
Before academia I was a project engineer leading build, test, commissioning, and maintenance of production line laser-scanning inspection equipment, working with major clients like IBM, Kodak, Dow Chemical, and Sony. In that role I learned a great deal about project and people management.
