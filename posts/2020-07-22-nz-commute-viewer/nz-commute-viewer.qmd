I somehow convinced myself in the break between two exhausting semesters in 2020 (yes, _that_ year) to enter [Stats NZ's There and back again visualization competition](https://www.stats.govt.nz/2018-census/there-and-back-again-data-visualisation-competition).

I learned a lot about a bunch of things along the way, but probably needed to take a step back and learn more about web development frameworks, as there is [altogether _too much_ handcrafted javascript in there](https://github.com/DOSull/commute-viewer/blob/master/commute-viewer-app/js/app.js). Nevertheless, I had fun and I am reasonably happy with the end result. Also... it still works over four years later, which might not be true if I'd used something smarter than vanilla JS.

Here's a screenshot for anyone not curious enough to click on the link.

No, I didn't win the competition. That was [this entry](https://commuter.waka.app/){target="_blank"} by Jono Cooper.
