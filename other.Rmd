This is a pretty random assortment of things I've worked on or played around with at various times that have any kind of web presence.

### NetLogo
+ A [collection of NetLogo models](https://dosull.github.io/pattern-and-process) to accompany [_Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process_](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119970792.html)
+ The beginnings of a collection of ['native' NetLogo utilities](https://github.com/DOSull/netlogo-utils)

### Aotearoan things
+ [NZ travel to work and study data visualized](https://github.com/DOSull/commute-viewer) in my not-winning entry to [there and back again](https://www.stats.govt.nz/2018-census/there-and-back-again-data-visualisation-competition)
+ [Mapping the Dulux colours of New Zealand](https://github.com/DOSull/dulux-colours-map)
+ [Tiled and woven maps](https://github.com/DOSull/weaving-space) of multivariate data

### COVID times
+ A [spatial COVID model](https://github.com/DOSull/spatial-epi) I made with colleagues
+ [Locations of interest in the August - ??? delta outbreak in Aotearoa](https://southosullivan.com/misc/loi.html). Note that these are _not_ the current locations of interest, but rather all of them over time, and at some point I will get fed up updating them.

### Even more random
+ [what3chords](https://github.com/DOSull/what3chords) (**health warning** turn down your volume!) some day this will be explained...  

### Other
+ An observable notebook to [make whirlpool spiral origami crease patterns](https://observablehq.com/@dosull/tomoko-fuse-spiral-crease-patterns)
