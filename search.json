      "contents": "\nGeographic Information Analysis with Dave Unwin, was first published in 2003, with a second edition in 2010, and we’re thinking about a third. It has been a mainstay of my teaching through all that time, and currently underpins much of the content of GISC 422 Spatial Analysis and Modelling.\nSpatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process with George Perry perhaps requires a little more explanation. It provides an advanced introduction to simple spatial simulation models for researchers in fields such as geography, planning, archaeology, ecology and so on. George and I felt that such models have great potential across the ‘spatial sciences’ but that the literature on them is scattered, which makes it a challenge for researchers in these fields to get started. We read all those mathematics, physics and statistics papers, so you don’t have to! A library of models which you can run in NetLogo accompanies the book, and can be downloaded from this repository.\n\n\n\n",
