      "contents": "\nGeographic\nInformation Analysis with Dave Unwin, was first published in\n2003, with a second edition in 2010, and we’re thinking about a third.\nIt has been a mainstay of my teaching through all that time, and\ncurrently underpins much of the content of GISC 422 Spatial Analysis and\nModelling.\nSpatial\nSimulation: Exploring Pattern and Process with George\nPerry perhaps requires a little more explanation. It provides an\nadvanced introduction to simple spatial simulation models for\nresearchers in fields such as geography, planning, archaeology, ecology\nand so on. George and I felt that such models have great potential\nacross the ‘spatial sciences’ but that the literature on them is\nscattered, which makes it a challenge for researchers in these fields to\nget started. We read all those mathematics, physics and statistics\npapers, so you don’t have to! A library of models which you can run in\nNetLogo accompanies\nthe book, and can be downloaded from this repository.\n\n\n\n",
