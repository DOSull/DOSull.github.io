# GISC 425 Emerging Topics in GIScience: Geographical Computing
Recent years have seen the (re)emergence of programmatic approaches to geographical information science and the de-emphasis of established desktop 'GIS' packages, both in research settings and in the commercial world. This class introduces the python programming language and the python geospatial ecosystem to prepare students for conducting research in this new context.

## Lecture and lab schedule
Here's the schedule we will aim to follow. **Bolded labs** have an associated assignment that must be submitted and contributes the indicated percentage of the course credit.

Week | Lecture topic | Lab topic | Notes
:----:|:------------- |:--------- |:---
1 | Course overview; why python | Getting set up
2 | Programming 1: variables and operators | **Introducing Jupyter notebooks** (10\%) | due week 3  
3 | Programming 2: functions builtin and user-defined; logic and flow control | **`geopandas`: reading and writing spatial data files; map projections** (10\%) | due week 4
4 | Programming 3: objects, modules and APIs | **Simple GIS operations in `geopandas`** (10\%) | due week 5 
5 | Programming 4: thinking computationally | **Is that point in this polygon?** (10%) | due week 6
6 | Simple static maps | **`matplotlib`** (10\%) | due week 7
&nbsp; | Trimester break  |
7 | APIs: Controlling QGIS and Arc with python | `arcpy` and `PyQGIS` | 
8 | Introducing the final assignment | **Getting started on the big assignment** (50\%) | due week 12  
9 | Other languages: same only different | `R` `javascript` `java` `netlogo` |
10 | Beyond notebooks | Virtual environments, command lines and IDEs |
11 | Version control | Introduction to github |
12 | Course review | No lab 

## Lectures
Lectures will generally consist of around an hour of presented material, and around 30 minutes of more open-ended discussion and Q&A based on the materials and on reading which students will have been expected to do ahead of class.

### Readings
A really great introduction to Python is provided by this freely available PDF book (also available to purchase), from which readings will be assigned, especially in the first half of trimester.

+ Downey A. 2015. [*Think Python: How to think like a Computer Scientist*](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) 2nd edn. Green Tea Press, Needham, MA.

Other useful resources are found online and will be called out in lectures as we proceed. There will probably be readings set from

+ Crickard P, E van Rees and S Toms. 2018. [*Mastering Geospatial Analysis with Python*](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-geospatial-analysis-python). Packt Publishing.

+ Westra E. 2016. [*Python geospatial development*](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-geospatial-development) 3rd edn. Packt Publishing.

These are both accessible via a university subscription through the library, and PDFs are purchasable for only US\$5.

## Labs
Five short lab assignments with a week for completion are intended to fix ideas and provide experience and buid confidence in writing short programs. One more substantial project will account for the remaining 50\% of course credit. Labs are expected to take more time to complete than is timetabled for lab session. The timetabled sessions are when you can get assistance from the course instructor most readily.

## Assessment
Assessment is based on five lab assignments worth 10\% each, and a final longer assignment worth 50% of course credit due at the end of the teaching weeks of trimester (i.e., in week 12).
