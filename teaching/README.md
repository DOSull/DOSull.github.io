# Teaching
## Current teaching at Victoria University of Wellington
You'll find these courses (all of which are current) at [my github account](https://github.com/DOSull). Almost all the materials are free to explore.

### Undergraduate
#### [Geography 315 Advanced GIS](https://github.com/DOSull/Geog315)
A 3rd year undergraduate class looking at geospatial analysis from an open data science perspective (most of the practical work is in *R*).

These courses are all part of the Postgraduate Diploma in Science an Masters programs in Geographic Information Science:

### Postgraduate (4th year)
#### [GISC 420 Geographical Computing](https://github.com/DOSull/GISC-420)
An introduction to programming using Python geospatial libraries such as `geopandas`.

#### [GISC 421 GIS Applications and Impact](https://github.com/DOSull/GISC-421)
An overview of the broader social, political, economic and cultural context of GIS picking up on themes in critical GIS, and putting it all (or trying to!) in an applied context in Aotearoa New Zealand.

#### [GISC 422 Spatial Analysis and Modelling](https://github.com/DOSull/GISC-422)
An introduction to spatial statistics looking at topics such as point pattern analysis, spatial autocorrelation and spatial interpolation. This draws heavily on my book with Dave Unwin [*Geographic Information Analysis*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470288574.html)

### Some previous teaching
Here are some materials from classes I taught at Berkeley Geography (including links to slides)
+ [Geography 80 Digital Worlds, an Introduction to Geospatial Technology](geog80-lectures.md)
+ [Geography 187 Geographic Information Analysis](geog187-lectures.md)
+ [Geography 254 Seeing Geographically](geography-254-syllabus.md)

I taught a bunch of other things there before I got into the habit of putting them on the open web.
