# Geog 315 Advanced GIScience
Recent years have seen the (re)emergence of programmatic approaches to geographical information science and the de-emphasis of established desktop 'GIS' packages, both in research settings and in the commercial world. This class introduces the python programming language and the python geospatial ecosystem to prepare students for work in this new context.

## Lecture and lab schedule
Here's the schedule we will aim to follow. **Bolded labs** have an associated assignment that must be submitted and contributes the indicated percentage of the course credit.

Week | Lecture 1 | Lecture 2 | Lab topic | Notes
:---:|:--------- |:--------- |:--------- |:-----
1 | Course overview | Brief history of GIS and geocomputation | No lab |
2 | Automating Arc: model builder | Under the hood | &nbsp; |
3 | Variables and simple data types | More complex data types | &nbsp; |
4 | Using functions | Writing your own functions | &nbsp; |
5 | Conditional statements | Flow control | &nbsp; |
6 | Structured programming | Thinking like a programmer | &nbsp; |
&nbsp; | Trimester break |
7 | `arcpy` | `PyQGIS` | &nbsp; |
8 | `geopandas` | `matplotlib` | &nbsp; | 
9 | Other languages: HTML and javascript | Simple webmaps | &nbsp; | 
10 | A more complicated webmap | Guest lecture 1 | &nbsp; |
11 | Guest lecture 2 | Guest lecture 3 | &nbsp; |
12 | Review | What next? | &nbsp;

## Lectures
Lectures will generally consist of around an hour of presented material, and around 30 minutes of more open-ended discussion and Q&A based on the materials and on reading which students will have been expected to do ahead of class.

### Readings
Details of readings will be provided ahead of class.

## Labs

## Assessment
Assessment is based on six lab assignments worth 10% each, and a final longer assignment worth 40% of course credit due at the end of the teaching weeks of trimester (i.e., in week 12).
