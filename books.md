I've co-authored two books, which people seem to find useful.

[Geographic Information Analysis](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470288574.html) with Dave Unwin, was first published in 2003, with a second edition in 2010, and we're thinking about a third. It has been a mainstay of my teaching through all that time, and currently underpins much of the content of [Geography 187]({filename}../teaching/geog187-lectures.md).

[Spatial Simulation: Exploring Pattern and Process](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119970792.html) with [George Perry](http://www.env.auckland.ac.nz/people/george-perry) perhaps requires a little more explanation. It provides an advanced introduction to simple spatial simulation models for researchers in fields such as geography, planning, archaeology, ecology and so on. George and I feel that such models have great potential across the 'spatial sciences' but that the basic literature on them is scattered and difficult, which makes it a challenge for researchers in these fields to get started. We read all those mathematics, physics and statistics papers, so you don't have to! A library of models which you can run in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) accompanies the book, and can be downloaded and explored from [this repository](https://github.com/DOSull/model-zoo).
