Title: A city is not a network either
Date: 18/09/17
Summary: Future of Urban Networks Symposium, Ghent, Belgium, Sept 18-20, 2017

This presentation was given at this [fantastic meeting](http://urbannetworks.org/2017-symposium) about the future of urban networks research.  As a side-note this was the first time I put pictures of my origami in a slideshow.  People seemed to enjoy it, without it distracting too much from the presentation!
