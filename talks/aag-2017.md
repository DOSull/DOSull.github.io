Summary: Annual Meeting of the AAG, Boston, April 2017

This was a paper presentation in one of the inaugural sessions of the Digital Geographies Specialty Group of the AAG. It's based on work with [Luc Guillemot](http://twitter.com/lucguillemot) who was a postdoc with us at the time, but  has moved on to work in the commercial world at [Interactive Things](https://www.interactivethings.com/).
