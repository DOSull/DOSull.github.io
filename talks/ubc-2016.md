Title: Future GIS
Date: 21/01/16
Summary: UBC Geography, January 21, 2016

This one is a little different. For a start, it's not really a research talk. I was asked along with [Matt Wilson](http://www.uky.edu/~mwwi222/) to go and talk with the [geography department at UBC](http://www.geog.ubc.ca/) about where GIS is heading as they consider their next moves in this ever-expanding (and ill-defined) field. I made these slides, which Matt was happy to add his name to. I'm not sure how much UBC geography got out of this, but it was an interesting trip, and a good opportunity to organize some thoughts.

You can view the slides below, but it may be better [in its own window](https://southosullivan.com/talks/UBC-Future-GIS/index.html).
