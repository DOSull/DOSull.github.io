Title: Searching for common ground (again)
Date: 30/09/16
Summary: GIScience 2016, Montreal

I gave this short presentation at GIScience in Montreal. The title is a nod to two edited collections from the 1980s, Gould and Olsson's [_A Search for Common Ground_](https://www.amazon.com/Search-Common-Ground-P-Gould/dp/0850860938) and Golledge, Couclelis and Gould's [_A Ground for Common Search_](https://www.amazon.com/Ground-Common-Search-Reginald-Golledge/dp/9999938833) which seem like documents from a long forgotten time when what we now call GIScientists and geographers more generally still engaged in serious conversations with one another about what it means to &lsquo;do geography&rsquo;.

I put these slides together a little hurriedly, and should have done more at the end to make my major argument, that GIScience could really benefit from a greater awareness of its history and origins (insofar as they lie in quantitative geography of the 1960s) and from renewing conversations with geography more broadly where many rich concepts and ideas about space, place and society have emerged over the last couple of decades. I was encouraged by the largely positive response to the talk.

The paper itself (it's very short) is [here](https://southosullivan.com/geodos/resources/SearchingForCommonGround-Again.pdf), and appears in the short paper proceedings of [GIScience 2016](http://giscience2016.org/). The paper is co-authored with [Jim Thatcher](http://jimthatcher.net/) and [Luke Bergmann](http://faculty.washington.edu/lrb9/).

You can view the slides below, but it may be better [in its own window](https://southosullivan.com/talks/GIScience2016-presentation/index.html).
