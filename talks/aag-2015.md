Date: 21/04/15
Summary: AAG 2015, Chicago, April 21

This talk is based on work with [George Perry](http://www.env.auckland.ac.nz/people/george-perry) where we are exploring the possibilities for extracting 'narrative arcs' from spatial simulation model results. You can view the slides below, but it may be better in its own window. Click [here](https://southosullivan.com/talks/AAG2015/index.html).
