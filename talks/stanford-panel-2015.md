Title: Narrative arcs in simulation models
Date: 07/05/15
Summary:  Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford, May 7, 2015

This talk was part of a panel discussion organized by the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](http://cesta.stanford.edu) at Stanford. It is based on work with [George Perry](http://www.env.auckland.ac.nz/people/george-perry) where we are exploring the possibilities for extracting 'narrative arcs' from spatial simulation model results.
