Title: Spatiality, maps, and mathematics in critical human geography
Date: 23/03/16
Summary: Uppsala Geography, March 23, 2016

I was in Uppsala at the invitation of [Brett Christophers](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N8-1036) to start work on a collaborative research project, and agreed to give a talk while I was there&mdash;albeit about something completely different. This work builds on conversations over the last year or so with [Luke Bergmann](http://faculty.washington.edu/lrb9/) and [Jim Thatcher](http://jimthatcher.net/).

This is probably as close as I've come to saying in public that I'm not sure GIS has been entirely good for the &lsquo;doing of geography&rsquo; with computers, a thought I've been hatching in a vague kind of way over the last few years.

It was a tremendous honor on this occasion that [Gunnar Olsson](http://katalog.uu.se/empInfo/?id=N96-1826) was in the audience. He even claims to have enjoyed the talk. There was a lot more emphasis in my &lsquo;script&rsquo; (that's too strong a word) on the significance of [Waldo Tobler](http://geog.ucsb.edu/~tobler/)&rsquo;s contribution than it may appear from the slides. Gunnar and Waldo were colleagues at Michigan for 11 years, some 40-50 years ago so perhaps nostalgia explains Gunnar's enjoyment... that, and the pictures by [Kandinsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky)!

You can view the slides below, but it may be better [in its own window](https://southosullivan.com/talks/Uppsala-SpatialityMapsMath/index.html).
