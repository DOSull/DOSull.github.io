Title: Simple spatial models: Building blocks for a process-based GIS?
Date: 03/11/16
Summary: Geolunch at the GIF, Berkeley, November 3, 2016

I probably need to retire this talk now, as I've given variants on it a number of times now, but whaddya know? I'd never given it at my home institution, so here it is (lightly edited) all over again. What I really need is someone that knows enough about design patterns and coding to figure out how a pattern language for spatial simulation models would actually work in practice!

You can view the slides below, but it may be better in its own window. Click [here](https://southosullivan.com/talks/GIF-Nov2016/index.html).
