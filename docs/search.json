    "section": "",
    "text": "Another ongoing project in collaboration with Luke Bergmann at University of British Columbia.\nThis is one aspect of a wider project aimed at developing maps where the geometry is based not on ‘location’ but on the relationships — whether of time, money, people, or anything else of interest between places. Space conceived not as a fixed absolute background to things but as a living moving thing that both shapes and is shaped by unfolding events.\nTime-space mapping is a particular subset of this wider project focused on relations of estimated travel time between locations in a mountainous environment. There’s more detail on what we’re up to in this presentation I gave at GeoCart 2024.\nYou’ll find a video of dynamic time-space in the presentation and there’s another in my diary entry about GeoCart. Meanwhile, here’s a series of maps of estimated hiking times from a given starting location on a series of idealised conical mountains of increasing steepness."

    "text": "I’m excited to be doing the mapping work in a recently funded project investigating the risks for establishment in New Zealand of Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries - Manatū Ahu Matua, and led by Prof Phil Lester.\nIt’s early days, and my initial work is focused on marshalling data on the distribution of bird species using the recently compiled NZ Bird Atlas. Here’s a map of local favourite kākā sitings.\n\n\n\nSitings of kākā in the NZ Bird Atlas\n\n\nIf this map seems more optimistic than others you’ve seen that’s because it is derived from raw sitings. Translating that information into more reliable ‘range’ maps is one aspect of the work we need to consider.\nThe reason where the birds are matters in this project is that establishment of JEV in New Zealand is most likely to occur as a result of it circulating in some bird populations (likely not kākā) from which mosquitoes might then pass it on to other populations."

There’s a lot of really great research going on outside the academy, something it is easy to lose site of when you’ve spent so long inside it."

For more information get in touch.\n\nResearch\nI am an accomplished geospatial researcher with over 25 years experience. I am an Honorary Professor at the University of Auckland and a Research Affiliate at Motu. You can find out more about my academic exploits from the drop-down above, or at Google Scholar.\nYou’ll find examples of my work in my portfolio and blog posts. To summarise:\n\n\nCommmunicating ideas\nI have written 3 books and numerous research articles. I have taught for over 20 years and can put together a mean slide show. I use web-formats, primarily revealjs and quarto. See my presentations, or the slides here. Years of teaching experience is the basis for the training I offer.\n\n\nCommunicating data\nI work all the time in R and Python developing workflows to tidy, reformat, analyse, and visualize data, especially spatial data. I am a trained cartographer, and have regularly worked on visual analytics or maps of complex data in research projects and publications. There are many examples among the blog posts.\n\n\nWrangling data\nI have been programming since forever. My everyday languages are Python and R, but I have experience in others (notably Java and JavaScript). I can write well organised and documented code. I am not a web developer, but will roll up my sleeves and figure stuff out as needed. Most of my web stuff is linked from these pages, so have a look around.\n\n\nSimulating stuff\nI love NetLogo, but admit that it is niche, albeit surprisingly powerful (see this geographical COVID model I built in lockdown. I’ve also written a book about this.\n\n\nProject management\nBefore academia I was a project engineer leading build, test, commissioning, and maintenance of production line laser-scanning inspection equipment, working with multinational clients such as IBM, Kodak, Dow Chemical, and Sony. In that role I learned a great deal about project and people management."

Its implementation of IDW interpolation is nice however, so it’s nice to know how to use it. Whether or not you should ever use IDW is another question altogether, but we can worry about that some other time.\n\nData\nFirst we need a set of values to interpolate. I made a projected version of the R core dataset volcano which is a nice place to start.\n\nmaungawhau &lt;-  rast(\"maungawhau.tif\")\n\n\n\nSome random control points and a study area\nWe can get a dataframe of random points on the surface using terra::spatSample.

    "text": "spatstat for density estimation\nThe best way I know to do density estimation in the R ecosystem is using the spatstat library’s specialisation of base R’s density function. That means converting the point data to a spatstat planar point pattern (ppp) object, which involves a couple of steps.\n\npts.ppp &lt;- pts$geom %&gt;% \n  as.ppp()\n\nA point pattern also needs a ‘window’, which we’ll make from the polygons.\n\npts.ppp$window &lt;- polys %&gt;%\n  st_union() %&gt;%       # combine all the polygons into a single shape\n  as.owin()            # convert to spatstat owin - again maptools...\n\n\nNow the kernel density\nWe need some bounding box info to manage the density estimation resolution\n\nbb &lt;- st_bbox(polys)\ncellsize &lt;- 100\nheight &lt;- (bb$ymax - bb$ymin) / cellsize\nwidth &lt;- (bb$xmax - bb$xmin) / cellsize\n\nNow we specify the size of the raster we want with dimyx (note the order, y then x) using height and width.\nWe can convert this directly to a raster, but have to supply a CRS which we pull from the original points input dataset. At the time of writing (August 2021) you’ll get a complaint about the New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000 because recent changes in how projections and datums are handled are still working themselves out.\n\nkde &lt;- density(pts.ppp, sigma = 500, dimyx = c(height, width)) %&gt;%\n  raster() \ncrs(kde) = st_crs(pts)$wkt  # a ppp has no CRS information so add it\n\n\n\nLet’s see what we got\nWe can map this using tmap.\n\ntm_shape(kde) +\n  tm_raster(palette =  \"Reds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fallback sanity check\nTo give us an alternative view of the data, let’s just count points in polygons\n\npolys$n &lt;- polys %&gt;%\n  st_contains(pts) %&gt;%\n  lengths()\n\nAnd map the result\n\ntm_shape(polys) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"n\", palette = \"Reds\", title = \"Points in polygons\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate the density surface pixels to polygons\nThis isn’t at all necessary, but is also useful to know. This is also a relatively slow operation. Note that we add together the density estimates in the pixels contained by each polygon.\n\nsummed_densities &lt;- raster::extract(kde, polys, fun = sum)\n\nAppend this to the polygons and rescale so the result is an estimate of the original count. We multiply by cellsize^2 because each cell contains an estimate of the per sq metre (in this case, but per sq distance unit in general) density, so multiplying by the area of the cells gives an estimated count.\n\npolys$estimated_count = summed_densities[, 1] * cellsize ^ 2\n\nAnd now we can make another map\n\ntm_shape(polys) + \n  tm_polygons(col = \"estimated_count\", palette = \"Reds\",\n              title = \"500m KDE summed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot the deliberate mistake?!\nSomething doesn’t seem quite right! What’s with the large numbers in the large rural area to the west of the city? Thing is, you shouldn’t really map count data like this, but should instead convert to densities. If we include that option in the tm_polygons function, then order is restored.\n\ntm_shape(polys) + \n  tm_polygons(col = \"estimated_count\", palette = \"Reds\", convert2density = TRUE,\n              title = \"500m KDE estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReally, this should be done with the earlier map of points in polygons too, so let’s show all three side by side. tmap_arrange is nice for this, although it has trouble making legend title font sizes match, unless you do some creative renaming. I’ve also multiplied the KDE result by 1,000,000 to convert the density to listings per sq. km, and we can see that the three maps are comparable.\n\nm1 &lt;- tm_shape(kde * 1000000) + \n  tm_raster(palette = \"Reds\", title = \"500m KDE\")\nm2 &lt;- tm_shape(polys) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"n\", palette = \"Blues\", convert2density = TRUE,\n              title = \"Point density\")\nm3 &lt;- tm_shape(polys) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"estimated_count\", palette = \"Greens\", convert2density = TRUE,\n              title = \"KDE summed\")\ntmap_arrange(m1, m2, m3, nrow = 1)"

It bore all the hallmarks of Igor’s vision for the meeting. Many keynotes (perhaps too many, but more on that below…) and many opportunities for informal discussion and exchange in the breaks between presentations, over lunch, and at the Icebreaker and Conference Dinner events.

    "section": "Keynotes",
    "text": "Keynotes\nSo many keynotes…\nA two-and-a-half day meeting with six (yes SIX!) ‘all-hands’ presentations seems perhaps a little too much of a good thing. Having said that, all the keynotes were excellent. Like, really excellent. I didn’t necessarily agree with everything everyone said, but I was certainly engaged throughout. In chronological order:\n\nOcean Mercier kicked things off with ‘Te Taunaha Whenua: Mapping Connections to Place’ emphasising the role that maps and mapping play in defining and making place, and the more than coincidental relationship between those processes and colonisation and (yay!) decolonisation. I loved that Ocean also shared her longtime passion for orienteering— and its slightly goofy (but highly functional) maps. She was even heading off rogaining one evening of the conference.2\n\n\nDaniel Huffman in their presentation ‘Sharing the Emotional Work of Mapping’ spoke to a topic that has been front of mind for me lately: the rollercoaster ride of the uncertainties of taking on projects as they appear, and balancing ambitions for your creative work against the expectations of paying clients. I have to confess to some disappointment that we didn’t get some Huffman eye candy along the way, but instead had to content ourselves with Madison, Wisconsin’s—admittedly very nice—flag.\n\n\nDaniel O’Donohue. After Daniel H’s quietly reflective take on the emotional journey of making maps, next morning podcaster and self-described geospatial evangelist Daniel O gave everyone a good kick in the pants encouraged us all to get busy making millions on the interwebs. Some of this talk leaned a bit too much for cycnical old gen-X-er me into the social media influencer vibe, but more than a couple of people were taking notes, and I expect to see mass-market cartography rocket to the top of Aoteroa’s export earnings charts in the years to come. Seriously though, I did have a couple of conversations with folks prompted by this talk to explore the possibilities for getting paid more for their skills. Being underpaid is a problem in cartography/geospatial,3 so I wish them all the best, and will join them, just as soon as I come up with an idea. Also: we all got socks.4\n\n\nDavid Garcia somehow managed to keep the energy going in a talk entitled ‘Revisiting the Social Nature of Mapping’. As in Daniel O’s talk, the memes were flowing, but so were the serious messages echoing both Ocean’s and Daniel H’s talks from the previous day in taking seriously the emotional heft of cartography, and its roles in colonisation and decolonisation. The recently minted Dr. Garcia wears his learning lightly and with great good humour, but his work is deeply serious. For a sense of just how serious, here’s the thesis in full. I have made my own (marginal) contributions to critical GIS and critical cartography, and even managed to inject a little of it into the program at VUW but I still learned a great deal from this talk (and I also laughed a lot…).\n\n\nSarah Bell introduced the final day with an emotionally5 nuanced presentation pushing us to carefully consider the many ways that maps can be biased. So far so obvious,6 but this talk added a few more dimensions for the manipulation of an audience, most poignantly sound, in an animated revisiting of Snow’s cholera data. As co-author of a book whose first edition cover featured the John Snow map, I was fully prepared to yawn my way through that part of the presentation, but this was very compelling.\n\n\nAnd finally, Wendy Shaw Toitū Te Whenua - Land Information New Zealand and Secretary of Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa - New Zealand Geographic Board, on the 100th anniversary of the board, updated us on progress in the ongoing consideration and restoration of Māori placenames across Aotearoa. The quick summary is that much has been done, and that much remains to be done. I scored a couple of the associated maps to add to Daniel O’s socks.\n\n\nToo much of a good thing?\nSo… I’ll say it again: all the keynotes were excellent. I can’t help wondering even so, if this balance in the meeting foregrounds the accomplishments of the already well-recognised, to the disadvantage of the great work being done by others.\nI am only really say this comparing GeoCart’s complement of keynotes relative to other conferences of similar size, where there is more likely to be one keynote a day, not two. In part the meeting follows this schedule to justify its two-and-a-half day duration so that there is space for two evening social events. There is likely not enough submitted work to make for two parallel tracks of presentations over that length of time. But I do wonder if in a small meeting like this two tracks are really needed. Cutting things back to three keynotes and a single track would make this a non-issue—and nobody would have to miss any of the talks!\nBut really, it’s not actually a problem, especially not if the keynotes can maintain this level of quality. And I know that for Igor a key mission for GeoCart was to connect cartography in Aotearoa New Zealand with the wider world, and keynotes from afar are one important way to do this. And having our visiting keynotes see the quality of the work in Aotearoa as exemplified in the ‘home team’ keynotes doesn’t hurt either.\nOne thing I do know is that finding that many keynote-worthy speakers every two years is a challenge: don’t hesitate to offer suggestions to the NZGS Committee!"

Say it with me: Te Taumata­whakatangi­hangakōauauo­tamatea­turi­pūkākā­pikimaunga­horonuku­pōkaiwhenua­kitanatahu.7 You can get some insight into the sorry tale of the use and abuse of the name from the wikipedia talk page for the place name itself.\nAndy Tyrell presented a really cool workflow for automating the production of linework style oblique terrain maps like these.\nCraig Devereux’s map of the Roman Empire which won the map contest was a standout and hard to beat.\nJessie Colbert’s presentation of work with Katarzyna Sila-Nowicka and Dan Exeter visualising maps of multiple deprivation was a model of completeness and clarity. I hope to maybe get involved in this work with my ‘dots within dots’ and weaving contributions.\nSam van der Weerden gave a great great talk about Maynard design’s work on the mapping for Auckland’s cycle network. Really interesting: particularly so was the insight that perhaps as cartographers we should sometimes resist our instinct to differentiate things by colour. After all, no matter what kind of cycle path it is, it’s still a cycle path and should be coloured green, and perhaps the less important differences among types of cycle path should be differentiated by line style not colour!\nDid I mention the dinner at Boatshed?\n\n\nSociety business\nAlso worth mentioning, the New Zealand Cartographic Society after somewhat inexplicably being refused permission to dual list its name in English and te reo Māori way back in 1989 (when doing so would have been well ahead of the curve) is finally en route, remaining bureaucratic hurdles notwithstanding, to adopting a te reo Māori name: Te Rōpū Tuhi Whenua o Aotearoa."

Before doing that, I’ll clean up nz.gpkg so it only has one layer again:\n\nnz |&gt; st_write(\"nz.gpkg\", layer = \"vector\", delete_dsn = TRUE)\n\nDeleting source `nz.gpkg' using driver `GPKG'\nWriting layer `vector' to data source `nz.gpkg' using driver `GPKG'\nWriting 1 features with 1 fields and geometry type Multi Polygon.\n\n\nNow load the raster layer\n\nlibrary(terra)\nnz_r &lt;- rast(\"nz.tif\")\nnz_r\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 144, 137, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 10000, 10000  (x, y)\nextent      : 1090144, 2460144, 4748531, 6188531  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000 (EPSG:2193) \nsource      : nz.tif \nname        : layer \nmin value   :     1 \nmax value   :     1 \n\n\nCrowbarring this thing into our GeoPackage is certainly possible, but it’s far from intuitive, and involves invoking some GDAL options.\n\nnz_r |&gt; \n  writeRaster(\"nz.gpkg\", \n              gdal = c(\"RASTER_TABLE=nzr\", \"APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES\"))\n\nThe GDAL options are all documented, but applying them using terra::writeRaster is finicky, and clearly this is not for the faint-hearted!\nFurthermore… sf can’t ‘see’ the raster layer:\n\nst_layers(\"nz.gpkg\")\n\nDriver: GPKG \nAvailable layers:\n  layer_name geometry_type features fields\n1     vector Multi Polygon        1      1\n                                         crs_name\n1 NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n\n\nI guess if you don’t ‘do’ raster layers then there is no point in being able to see them either ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. terra is similarly see-no-evil about things and just reads in the raster layer that is in the file without commenting on other layers that might be present:\n\nrast(\"nz.gpkg\")\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 144, 137, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 10000, 10000  (x, y)\nextent      : 1090144, 2460144, 4748531, 6188531  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000 (EPSG:2193) \nsource      : nz.gpkg \nname        : Height \n\n\nQGIS actually does better here. It certainly sees both layers:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that the QGIS Browser panel makes mixing raster and vector layers into your GeoPackages straightforward.\n\nOverall, I’ve been aware that I can bundle raster and vector layers in GeoPackages like this but haven’t used the capability. In part because I’ve only just figured out how to do it using the R tools(!), but mostly because I prefer to keep raster data in GeoTIFFs and vector data in GeoPackages so I can tell which is which at a glance."

    "text": "Many layers\nI’ve tended to shy away from packaging multiple datasets in GeoPackages as support for this feature has at times been uncertain and confusing.\nNow that I am less beholden to not confusing beginners where ‘one file = one layer’ is a useful rule to live by, I’ve started to look more closely at what’s going on here. It still has the potential to confuse — especially in QGIS’s right-click Export → Save Features As… — but there is untapped potential here for making life easier when it comes to sharing bundles of related data with a minimum of fuss.\nI’ll explain using my goto tool for general data wrangling, R’s sf package.\n\nMulti-layer geopackages in R\nAssuming you have a locally stored simple GeoPackage nz.gpkg, you read it using:\n\nlibrary(sf)\nnz &lt;- st_read(\"nz.gpkg\")\n\nReading layer `nz' from data source \n  `/Users/david/Documents/code/dosull.github.io/posts/2024-10-16-geopackages/nz.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 1090144 ymin: 4748531 xmax: 2463348 ymax: 6191876\nProjected CRS: NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n\n\nNow, if you’d like to add another layer to that file, you can specify a layer to put it in. Before doing that, it’s probably best to check what layers are already there using st_layers():\n\nst_layers(\"nz.gpkg\")\n\nDriver: GPKG \nAvailable layers:\n  layer_name geometry_type features fields\n1         nz Multi Polygon        1      1\n                                         crs_name\n1 NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n\n\nAs we might expect (and if you’ll excuse the awkward formatting due to the long crs_name) a single layer with the same layer name as the file itself. Say we buffer our data and want to store it back into the same file, then we can do the below, as long as we provide a new layer name to store it in:\n\nnz |&gt; \n  st_buffer(12000) |&gt; \n  st_write(\"nz.gpkg\", layer = \"coast\")\n\nWriting layer `coast' to data source `nz.gpkg' using driver `GPKG'\nWriting 1 features with 1 fields and geometry type Multi Polygon.\n\n\nAnd now we can see that both layers are present in the file:\n\nst_layers(\"nz.gpkg\")\n\nDriver: GPKG \nAvailable layers:\n  layer_name geometry_type features fields\n1         nz Multi Polygon        1      1\n2      coast Multi Polygon        1      1\n                                         crs_name\n1 NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n2 NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n\n\nNow if you open this file in R unless you specify the layer you want, you’ll just get the first one:\n\nst_read(\"nz.gpkg\")\n\nMultiple layers are present in data source /Users/david/Documents/code/dosull.github.io/posts/2024-10-16-geopackages/nz.gpkg, reading layer `nz'.\nUse `st_layers' to list all layer names and their type in a data source.\nSet the `layer' argument in `st_read' to read a particular layer.\n\n\nWarning in CPL_read_ogr(dsn, layer, query, as.character(options), quiet, :\nautomatically selected the first layer in a data source containing more than\none.\n\n\nReading layer `nz' from data source \n  `/Users/david/Documents/code/dosull.github.io/posts/2024-10-16-geopackages/nz.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 1090144 ymin: 4748531 xmax: 2463348 ymax: 6191876\nProjected CRS: NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n\n\nand one of those warning messages it’s tempting not to read, but is very much worth your time in this case.\n\n\nMulti-layer geopackages in QGIS\nMeanwhile, if you open a two-layer GPKG in QGIS you’ll see this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s pretty clear. What’s unfortunately less clear than in R is the sequence of operations that will safely add a layer to an existing GeoPackage. That’s not quite fair: what is unclear is the warning message you will get if you choose an existing .gpkg file as the destination for a right-click Export → Save Features As… operation from an entry in the Layers panel. The warning message looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems pretty scary. Before trying this I’d advise you to make a copy of the target geopackage if you are concerned about losing your data, but if you steel yourself and against every instinct select Replace, then as long as you set a different name in the Layer name option of the Save Vector Layer as… dialog:\n\n\n\n\n\nit will be fine, and you’ll end up with an additional layer in the target GeoPackage.\nYou can also manage the component layers of GeoPackages in QGIS’s Browser panel."

    "text": "During those ahem… heady days of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Aotearoa (7 or 8 weeks in April-May 2020) I worked intensely with colleagues on a simple spatial simulation model of the pandemic in New Zealand.\nInitially we hoped that we might get involved in the ongoing modelling efforts which the government was using to manage the national response given how self-evidently geographical a thing an epidemic is. But that clearly wasn’t a perspective shared by the public health professionals and others advising the government. Either that or they were just too damn busy dealing with events to welcome the additional distraction of thinking about the geography of the disease.\nOr maybe they thought it was just too much:\n\nWhatever the reason, we never did get involved in the national response, although it was clear by the time of the outbreak in later 2021 that they were, at least by then, thinking geographically about how to manage things. Anyway, you can play with the model by clicking below.\n\nGo to the model\n\nIt’s quite slow to load, and if you aren’t smart about the settings you use it’s likely to rapidly spin out of control (just like a uh… pandemic) and slow things down dramatically. For that reason I advise only using the go-one-day or go-one-week buttons until you get a feel for things.\nWe published a paper explaining the inner workings here:\n\nO’Sullivan D, M Gahegan, DJ Exeter, and B Adams. 2020.

    "text": "So, are GeoPackages perfect?\nOf course not. There’s an argument to be made that every format that perpertuates the simple features paradigm is a bad as every other. I even wrote a book that is — kind of — all about this. It’s one of the mysteries of the evolution of geospatial that topology was embedded in the ‘standard’ formats, until it wasn’t. For what it’s worth, I think we have relational databases to blame for that.\nGeoPackages don’t get us out of floating point geometry hell either.\nThere are also better formats for particular applications. GeoJSON is web-native in a way that GeoPackages never will be, and newer formats such as FlatGeoBuf and GeoParquet, and more recent approaches like Discrete Global Grids certainly have their place.\nBut in a world still dominated by relational DBMS, a geospatial format that is basically a wrapper around SQLite tables was almost certain to emerge eventually, and GeoPackages are that format. They’re vastly preferable to shapefiles, and it’s good to see them slowly (more quickly would be better) replacing them.\nThe shapefile is (almost) dead, long live the GeoPackage!"
