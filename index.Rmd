I am Professor of Geography and Geospatial Science at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Best you check out my [web page there](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sgees/about/staff/david-osullivan) for details.  I've moved around a fair bit and previously held positions at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Auckland, and Penn State.

Roughly speaking I'm interested in everything, but with an emphasis on the implications of complexity science for geographical research, and more recently, on the implications of geospatial technologies for everyday life.
